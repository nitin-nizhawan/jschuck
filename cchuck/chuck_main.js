//             normally not use allocate(), and instead allocate memory using _malloc(),

//        in *bytes* (note that this is sometimes confusing: the next parameter does not
//        affect this!)
// @types: Either an array of types, one for each byte (or 0 if no type at that position),
//         or a single type which is used for the entire block. This only matters if there
//         is initial data - if @slab is a number, then this does not matter at all and is
//         ignored.
